It's realy easy to use this class.

Example:

Creation a CAPTCHA:
  $mvcaptcha = new mvcaptcha('aceptar');

To check if the button Aceptar was pressed using 
  $captcha->verformulario()
  
To show the captcha use
  echo $captcha->vermvcaptcha('./ok.php','./error.php');
  The first parameter is the URL to which to turn when the answer is correct
  The second parameter is the URL to which to turn when the answer is wrong

To verify the data use
	$captcha->proceder();

That's it :)
