==[ Foreword ]==
This version is completely redesigned with a fancy new look of CAPTCHA.
In order to simplify the the usage, I also redisgned the interface.

The newest Version can be found at [1].

==[ Requirements ]==
- PHP >= 4.0.1
- TTF support
- Some fonts
- GD Library

==[ Fonts ]==
Before you can start using this class, you need some fonts.

==[ Usage ]==
It's realy easy to use this class.

Example:

Generation a CAPTCHA:

  $mvcaptcha = new mvcaptcha();

To check if the button Aceptar was pressed using  
  $captcha->verformulario()
  
To create the mvCaptcha use  
  $captcha->crearmvcaptcha('./ok.php','./error.php');
  The first parameter is the URL to which to turn when the answer is correct
  The second parameter is the URL to which to turn when the answer is wrong
	
To show the captcha use
  echo $captcha->getHTML();


To verify the data using
	$captcha->proceder();

That's it :)
